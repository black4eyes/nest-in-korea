hvac_state
Indicates whether HVAC system is actively heating, cooling or is off. Use this value to indicate HVAC activity state.

type	string enum
values	"heating", "cooling", "off"
permissions / permissions version	You can read this data value when these permissions are selected:
• Thermostat read / v3-v5
• Thermostat read/write / v3-v5
considerations	When "off", the HVAC system is not actively heating or cooling.
hvac_state is independent of fan operation.

humidity
Humidity, in percent (%) format, measured at the device, rounded to the nearest 5%.

type	number
example	35, 40
permissions / permissions version	You can read this data value when these permissions are selected:
• Thermostat read / v2-v5
• Thermostat read/write / v2-v5
considerations	Humidity is limited to a range of 0-100.


ambient_temperature_c
Temperature, measured at the device, in half degrees Celsius (0.5°C).

type	number
example	21.5
permissions / permissions version	You can read this data value when these permissions are selected:
• Thermostat read / v1-v5
• Thermostat read/write / v1-v5


hvac_mode
Indicates HVAC system heating/cooling modes. For systems with both heating and cooling capability, set this value to "heat-cool" (Heat • Cool mode) to get the best experience.

type	string enum
values	"heat", "cool", "heat-cool", "off"
example	"heat-cool"
permissions / permissions version	You can read this data value when these permissions are selected:
• Thermostat read / v1-v5
• Thermostat read/write / v1-v5
You can write this data value when this permission is selected:
• Thermostat read/write / v1-v5
considerations	When hvac_mode="off", then target_temperature_f and target_temperature_c cannot be changed.


target_temperature_c
Desired temperature, in half degrees Celsius (0.5°C). Used when hvac_mode = "heat" or "cool".

type	number
example	21.5
permissions / permissions version	You can read this data value when these permissions are selected:
• Thermostat read / v1-v5
• Thermostat read/write / v1-v5
You can write this data value when this permission is selected:
• Thermostat read/write / v1-v5
considerations	Target temperature is limited to a range of 9 - 32°C.
